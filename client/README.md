### npm i concurrently

- This module allows you to run multiple commands or servers concurrently with a single command. It's useful when you have both frontend and backend servers that need to be started simultaneously. By using concurrently, you can launch both with one command rather than running separate terminal windows for each server.

### npm i cors

- This module enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for your backend server, allowing it to handle requests from different domains, such as when the frontend and backend are hosted on different ports. It prevents CORS-related errors by managing the sharing of resources between two applications running on separate ports, typically for a frontend and backend setup.
